### âš™ What is this?
- Youtube Ad Skip Key is a chrome extension.

### ðŸ›  What does it do?
- Youtube Ad Skip Key is an extension that provides you a shortcut key to skip youtube ads. It does not block ads.

- This extension simulates the process of clicking "Skip Ads" and clicking the "x" button of those ads at the bottom of the Youtube player.

- This is for people who still want to support creators by watching ads, and sometimes don't want to skip ads right when the timer ends because some ads are interesting. It also closes those ads at the bottom that sometimes pop up.

- The default shortcut key is 'S'. This extension only supports typing keys such as "B-Z", "0-9", "-=[]\;'./", spacebar and enter key.

- *For some reasons, 'A' key has a problem where it won't work if the user focus is on the youtube player.
