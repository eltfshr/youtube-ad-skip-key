---
### âš™ What is this?
- Youtube Ad Skip Key is a chrome extension.

### ðŸ›  What does it do?
- Youtube Ad Skip Key is an extension that provides you a shortcut key/ button to skip youtube ads. It does not block ads.

- This extension simulates the process of clicking "Skip Ads", clicking the "x" button of those ads at the bottom of the Youtube player and clicking the "No Thanks" or "Skip Trial" of Youtube Premium ads.

- This is for people who still want to support creators by watching ads, and sometimes don't want to skip ads right when the timer ends because some ads are interesting. It also closes those ads at the bottom and Youtube Premium ads that sometimes pop up.

- The default shortcut key is 'Z'. This extension only supports typing keys such as "A-Z", "0-9", "-=[]\;'./~", numpad keys, spacebar and enter key.

- *You must change tabs to the ad-playing youtube tab to be able to close the ad.
- *You should avoid assigning shortcut to keys that are already assigned by Youtube such as A, C, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, W, "0-9", <, >, /, [, ], -, =, Numpad+, Numpad-, Numpad0-9 and Spacebar
- *If you are also using Youtube Music, you should also avoid these keys: E, G, H, Q, R, ;
- *It does not support combination of ALT, CTRL, SHIFT + supported keys.
